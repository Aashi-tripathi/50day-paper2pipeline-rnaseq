## 50-Day Paper → Pipeline Challenge (RNA-seq)

This repository documents my 50-day learning journey where I study RNA-seq
research papers and gradually convert them into small, reproducible
bioinformatics pipelines using Python.

### Goal
- Build strong RNA-seq fundamentals
- Improve Python and bioinformatics skills
- Learn reproducible research practices (Git, documentation)

### Current Status
- Day 1: Project setup, Python environment, Git & GitHub configuration - DONE
- Day 2: Understanding scRNA-seq data structures
- Day 3: Conceptual understanding of scRNA-seq data structures
