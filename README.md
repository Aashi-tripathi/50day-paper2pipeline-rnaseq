## 50-Day Paper → Pipeline Challenge (RNA-seq)

This repository documents my 50-day learning journey where I study RNA-seq
research papers and gradually convert them into small, reproducible
bioinformatics pipelines using Python.

### Goal
- Build strong RNA-seq fundamentals
- Improve Python and bioinformatics skills
- Learn reproducible research practices (Git, documentation)

### Current Status
- Day 1: Project setup, Python environment, Git & GitHub configuration - DONE
- Day 3 : Understanding scRNA-seq Data Structures

Focus:
- Conceptual understanding of single-cell RNA-seq
- How raw sequencing data is transformed into:
  - Gene expression count matrix
  - Cell-level and sample-level metadata

Key topics covered:
- Difference between bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq
- scRNA-seq experimental workflow
- Role of barcodes and UMIs
- What a count matrix represents biologically
- What metadata contains and why it matters in analysis

Outcome:
- Built a strong foundation to interpret scRNA-seq methods sections
- Prepared to map research papers to computational pipelines
