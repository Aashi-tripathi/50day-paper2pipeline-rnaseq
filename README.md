## 50-Day Paper → Pipeline Challenge (RNA-seq)

This repository documents my 50-day learning journey where I study RNA-seq
research papers and gradually convert them into small, reproducible
bioinformatics pipelines using Python.

### Goal
- Build strong RNA-seq fundamentals
- Improve Python and bioinformatics skills
- Learn reproducible research practices (Git, documentation)

### Current Status
- Day 1: Project setup, Python environment, Git & GitHub configuration - DONE
- Day 2: Understanding RNA-seq Data
  Count matrices: rows = genes, columns = samples, values = read counts
  Metadata: sample conditions, replicates, and other experimental details
  Connecting paper descriptions to actual data objects
  Small Python experiment to visualize count matrix structure
